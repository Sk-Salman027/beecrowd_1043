## Triangle
### Problem Statement
<p>Read three point floating values (A, B and C) and verify if is possible to make a triangle with them. If it is possible, calculate the perimeter of the triangle and print the message:<br>


<li>Perimetro = XX.X</li>


<li>If it is not possible, calculate the area of the trapezium which basis A and B and C as height, and print the message:</li>


<li>Area = XX.X</li></p>

### Input
<p>The input file has tree floating point numbers.
</p>

### Output
<p>Print the result with one digit after the decimal point.
</p>

### Condition for forming triangle:
<p>To determine whether three lengths can form a triangle, they must satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem states that for any three lengths  a,b, & c:</p><br>

`1. a + b > c`

`2. a + c > b`

`3. b + c > a`

<b>Note:</b> `If all three conditions are met, the lengths can form a triangle. If any of these conditions is violated, the lengths cannot form a triangle.`
